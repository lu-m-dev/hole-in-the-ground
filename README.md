## Gameplay
- You play as **a hole in the ground**.
- Control hole movement using WASD.
- The hole becomes bigger each time an object falls inside it.
- Swallow the world!

## Features
- Physically-based rigid body motion (gravity, friction, restitution)
- Collision detection and position correction
